## Personalized Academic Plan for Student ID 3

This plan addresses the learning needs of Student ID 3 based on their query history across MAD2 and BDM courses.  The focus is on strengthening understanding of `axios` within the MAD2 context and solidifying the concept of `profit` within BDM.

**1. Areas for Improvement:**

* **MAD2 (Axios):** The student has submitted multiple queries regarding `axios`, indicating a significant knowledge gap in using this HTTP client for making API requests.  This likely includes challenges with request setup (headers, parameters, data), handling responses (status codes, data extraction), and potentially error management.
* **BDM (Profit):** While only one query was submitted about `profit`, it suggests the student may need further clarification on this fundamental business concept. This could involve understanding different types of profit (gross, net, operating), calculating profit margins, or interpreting profit figures in financial statements.

**2. Recommended Resources:**

* **Axios:**
    * **MDN Web Docs:** Comprehensive documentation on using `axios` with clear explanations and examples. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client-side_requests/Using_XMLHttpRequest)
    * **Axios GitHub Repository:**  Access the official documentation, explore issues, and find community solutions. (https://github.com/axios/axios)
    * **Tutorial Videos:** Search for "axios tutorial for beginners" on platforms like YouTube for practical demonstrations.  Focus on videos that cover real-world use cases and best practices.
    * **Code Examples:** Websites like Stack Overflow and CodePen offer practical examples of `axios` implementations that can be adapted and experimented with.
* **Profit:**
    * **Khan Academy:** Look for resources on financial statements and business basics, which typically cover profit calculations and interpretations. (https://www.khanacademy.org/)
    * **Investopedia:** This website provides definitions and explanations of various profit-related terms and concepts. (https://www.investopedia.com/)
    * **Textbook Resources:** Review the relevant chapters in the BDM course textbook that cover profit and its related concepts.
    * **Instructor's Slides/Notes:** Revisit the course materials provided by the instructor, paying close attention to examples and explanations related to profit.

**3. Weekly Study Schedule:**

**(Allocate approximately 3-4 hours per week for each topic, adjusting based on the student's pace and understanding.)**

**Week 1: Focus on Axios**
* **Monday:** Review MDN documentation on `axios` basics (1 hour). Practice basic GET requests (1 hour).
* **Wednesday:** Watch tutorial videos on handling responses and error management (1.5 hours). Implement a simple API call in a personal project (1.5 hours).
* **Friday:** Explore advanced `axios` features like interceptors and transformers (1 hour).  Review and debug code from previous exercises (1 hour).

**Week 2: Focus on Profit**
* **Monday:** Review textbook chapters and instructor's notes on profit (1.5 hours). Solve practice problems related to profit calculation (1.5 hours).
* **Wednesday:** Explore Investopedia for deeper understanding of different profit types and their significance (1 hour). Analyze a simple income statement to identify profit figures (1 hour).
* **Friday:**  Review and consolidate understanding of profit concepts (1 hour).  Seek clarification from the instructor or TA on any remaining doubts (1 hour).

**Week 3 & Beyond:**  Continue practicing both `axios` and `profit` concepts through coding exercises, real-world projects, and case studies.  Allocate time for review and consolidation of learned material.

**4. Additional Support Recommendations:**

* **Reach out to the instructors or TAs for MAD2 and BDM for personalized assistance and clarification on specific questions.**  Don't hesitate to ask for help during office hours or through online forums.
* **Form study groups with classmates to discuss challenging concepts, share resources, and collaborate on practice exercises.** Peer learning can be highly effective in reinforcing understanding.
* **Consider online tutoring platforms or coding communities for additional support and guidance.** Websites like Stack Overflow and various online tutoring services can provide valuable assistance.
* **Practice consistently. The key to mastering both `axios` and `profit` is regular practice and application in different contexts.**  Work on personal projects, contribute to open-source projects, or participate in coding challenges to solidify your understanding.
