## Personalized Academic Plan for Student ID 3

This plan focuses on improving understanding of Axios within the context of the MAD2 course.

**1. Areas for Improvement:**

The student's query history indicates a need for focused study on Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.  This suggests potential difficulty with making HTTP requests, handling responses, and integrating Axios into JavaScript projects. Specific areas for improvement might include:

* **Understanding Promises:**  Axios relies heavily on promises.  A strong grasp of promise syntax (`.then`, `.catch`, `async/await`) is crucial.
* **Making different request types:**  Learning to use Axios for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP request methods.
* **Handling responses:**  Processing successful responses, managing errors, and extracting data from responses.
* **Setting headers and request options:**  Configuring Axios requests with custom headers for authentication, content type, etc.
* **Interceptors:** Understanding and implementing Axios interceptors for request/response modification.


**2. Recommended Resources:**

* **Official Axios Documentation:** The official documentation is a comprehensive resource. Start here for detailed explanations and examples. [https://axios-http.com/](https://axios-http.com/)
* **MDN Web Docs - Promises:**  Solid foundation on JavaScript promises. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
* **FreeCodeCamp - Axios Tutorial:**  Practical tutorials and exercises on using Axios. Search for "Axios tutorial" on their website. [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* **YouTube Tutorials:** Search for "Axios tutorial" on YouTube for video explanations and examples.  Focus on tutorials that cover the specific areas mentioned above (e.g., "Axios interceptors tutorial").


**3. Weekly Study Schedule:**

This schedule focuses on a deep dive into Axios over a week. Adjust the time commitment based on your other courses and commitments.

* **Monday:** Review JavaScript Promises (MDN Web Docs).  Practice basic promise syntax. (1-2 hours)
* **Tuesday:** Introduction to Axios. Work through the official documentation's getting started guide and basic examples.  (2 hours)
* **Wednesday:**  Focus on different request types (GET, POST, etc.) using Axios.  Create small practice projects involving making different types of requests to a test API. (2-3 hours)
* **Thursday:**  Handling responses and errors in Axios.  Practice error handling and data extraction from responses. (2 hours)
* **Friday:**  Advanced Axios topics: interceptors, custom headers, request configuration. (1-2 hours)
* **Weekend:**  Review and consolidate learning.  Build a small project that integrates Axios for data fetching or API interaction. (2-4 hours)


**4. Additional Support Recommendations:**

* **Code Practice:**  The key to mastering Axios is practice.  Create small projects that use Axios for various tasks.  Consider using a mock API for testing.
* **Debugging:** Learn to use browser developer tools to debug Axios requests and responses.  This will help identify and fix issues quickly.
* **Ask for Help:**  Don't hesitate to ask for help from instructors, TAs, or online communities if you encounter difficulties.  Be specific with your questions and provide code examples.
* **Peer Learning:**  Study with classmates and work together on Axios-related projects. Explaining concepts to others can solidify your understanding.
* **Office Hours:** Take advantage of instructor office hours to ask specific questions and get personalized guidance.


This plan provides a structured approach to learning Axios.  Remember to adapt it to your learning style and pace. Consistent effort and practice are crucial for success.  Good luck!
