# Academic Plan for Student s2001

## Personalized Academic Plan for Student s2001

**Student ID:** s2001

**1. Areas for Improvement:**

Based on the student's queries and the course content, the following areas require focused attention:

* **Understanding of Core Economic Principles (from BDM):** While the student has queried about "demand" and "supply," these are fundamental concepts in BDM.  The relatively low overall query count for BDM suggests a potential lack of engagement with the material or a passive learning approach.  It's crucial to solidify understanding of these foundational elements, including their interaction to determine market equilibrium and the influence of factors like price and elasticity.
* **Decision Trees and their Application (from MLP):** The query "trees?" indicates uncertainty or confusion regarding decision trees, a key topic in MLP.  Given the higher overall query count for MLP compared to BDM, the student might be struggling to grasp the practical application of decision trees in machine learning, including their construction, interpretation, and advantages/disadvantages compared to other algorithms.  The connection between "decision" queries in both courses suggests a possible difficulty applying decision-making frameworks in different contexts.


**2. Recommended Resources:**

* **For BDM (Demand & Supply):**
    * **Textbook:** Review the relevant chapters in the assigned BDM textbook, paying close attention to definitions, graphs, and examples.
    * **Khan Academy:**  Search for videos and exercises on "supply and demand," "market equilibrium," and "elasticity."
    * **Investopedia:** This website offers clear explanations of economic concepts and real-world applications.
* **For MLP (Decision Trees):**
    * **Course Slides & Notes:** Revisit the lecture materials specifically covering decision trees.
    * **Online Tutorials:** Explore resources like StatQuest on YouTube, which provides intuitive explanations of statistical and machine learning concepts, including decision trees.
    * **Practical Exercises:** Work through coding examples using libraries like scikit-learn in Python to build and evaluate decision tree models.  Datasets available on Kaggle can provide practical experience.


**3. Weekly Study Schedule:**

**(Allocate approximately 5-7 hours per course per week)**

**BDM:**

* **Monday:** Review textbook chapter on demand and supply (1.5 hours).
* **Tuesday:** Complete practice problems on demand and supply curves (1 hour). Watch Khan Academy videos on market equilibrium (1 hour).
* **Thursday:** Read Investopedia articles on real-world applications of supply and demand (1 hour).
* **Saturday:** Review and consolidate learned concepts, prepare questions for the instructor (1 hour).


**MLP:**

* **Monday:** Review lecture slides and notes on decision trees (1.5 hours).
* **Tuesday:** Watch StatQuest videos on decision trees (1 hour).  Begin working on a coding exercise (1 hour).
* **Thursday:** Continue working on coding exercise, focusing on implementation and interpretation (1.5 hours).
* **Saturday:** Explore Kaggle for relevant datasets and consider potential project ideas using decision trees (1 hour).


**4. Additional Support Recommendations:**

* **BDM:** If the student continues to struggle with fundamental economic principles, consider attending office hours or seeking help from a tutor specializing in economics.  Working through additional practice problems and discussing concepts with classmates can also be beneficial.
* **MLP:** For challenges with decision trees, actively participate in online forums or study groups dedicated to machine learning.  Breaking down the concept into smaller parts, focusing on the logic behind each step in building a decision tree, and visualizing the process can aid understanding.  Practice with different datasets and algorithms will solidify the learning.
* **General:**  The student should actively participate in class, ask clarifying questions, and engage in discussions.  Effective note-taking and regular review of material are crucial for retention.  Connecting the concepts learned in each course to real-world examples can also enhance understanding and motivation.
