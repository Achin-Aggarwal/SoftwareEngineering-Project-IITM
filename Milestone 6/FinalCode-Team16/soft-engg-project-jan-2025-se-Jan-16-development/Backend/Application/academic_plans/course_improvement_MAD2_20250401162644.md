# Improvement Plan for Course: MAD2

## MAD2 Course Improvement Plan

Based on the query data, it's clear that students are struggling with the concept of Axios. While the sample size is small (one student, three queries), the repeated nature of the query indicates a significant knowledge gap that needs to be addressed.

**1. Identified Gaps in Current Materials:**

The current course materials lack sufficient explanation and practical application examples of the Axios library.  Students are unsure of even the basic definition of Axios, suggesting an introductory explanation is missing. The lack of varied queries related to specific Axios functionalities might indicate the student struggled early on and didn't progress to more complex usage.

**2. Suggested Content Improvements:**

* **Introduce Axios clearly:**  Begin with a clear definition of Axios: "Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It's used to make HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to communicate with APIs and servers."
* **Explain the benefits of using Axios:** Highlight why Axios is preferred over other methods (e.g., the Fetch API), such as its ease of use, automatic JSON transformation, error handling capabilities, and request/response interception.
* **Provide practical examples:** Include diverse code examples demonstrating common Axios use cases:
    * Making GET requests to retrieve data.
    * Making POST requests to send data.
    * Handling different response types (JSON, text, etc.).
    * Setting headers (e.g., for authorization).
    * Handling errors and implementing retries.
    * Using interceptors for global request/response modification.
* **Explain Promises and async/await:** Since Axios is promise-based, ensure the course materials adequately cover these concepts.  Explain how to use `then()` and `catch()` for handling responses and errors, and demonstrate the use of `async` and `await` for cleaner asynchronous code.


**3. Recommended Additional Resources:**

* **Create a dedicated Axios cheat sheet:**  A concise reference guide with common Axios methods, options, and error handling techniques would be beneficial.
* **Develop interactive exercises:**  Hands-on exercises where students can practice making API calls and handling responses would reinforce learning.  Consider using a mock API for these exercises.
* **Link to official Axios documentation:**  Provide a direct link to the official Axios documentation for further exploration and reference.
* **Curate a list of helpful blog posts and tutorials:**  Supplement the course materials with external resources that offer different perspectives and deeper dives into specific Axios functionalities.


**4. Proposed Structural Changes:**

* **Introduce Axios earlier in the curriculum:** If Axios is crucial for later modules, introduce it earlier to give students ample time to understand and practice using it.
* **Dedicate a specific module or lesson to Axios:** Instead of scattering information about Axios throughout the course, create a dedicated section that covers it comprehensively.
* **Revisit Axios concepts in subsequent modules:**  Reinforce learning by incorporating Axios into practical examples and exercises in later modules where API interaction is relevant.
* **Add a quiz or assessment specifically on Axios:**  This will help gauge student understanding and identify areas where further clarification is needed.


By implementing these improvements, the MAD2 course can effectively address the identified gaps in Axios instruction, providing students with the necessary knowledge and skills to confidently utilize this essential library.  The focus on practical application and readily available resources will empower students to successfully integrate Axios into their projects.
