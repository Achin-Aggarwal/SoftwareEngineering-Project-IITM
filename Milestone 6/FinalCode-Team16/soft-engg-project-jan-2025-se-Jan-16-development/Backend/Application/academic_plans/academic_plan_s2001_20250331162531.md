# Academic Plan for Student s2001

## Personalized Academic Plan for Student s2001

**Student ID:** s2001

**1. Areas for Improvement:**

Based on the student's queries and the course content, the following areas require focused attention:

* **Understanding of Core Economic Principles (from BDM):** While the student has queried about "demand" and "supply," these are fundamental concepts in BDM.  The relatively low overall query count for BDM suggests a potential lack of engagement with the material or a passive learning approach.  A deeper understanding of market mechanisms, including price determination and elasticity (common topics in BDM), is crucial.
* **Decision Trees and their Application (from MLP):** The query "trees?" indicates uncertainty about decision trees, a key topic in MLP.  Given the frequency of "linear" and "regression" queries across all students, it's possible the student is focusing more on these aspects and neglecting decision trees.  A stronger grasp of decision tree construction, interpretation, and advantages/disadvantages compared to other methods is needed.


**2. Recommended Resources:**

* **For BDM (Focus on strengthening foundational knowledge):**
    * **Textbook Review:** Revisit the chapters on demand, supply, market equilibrium, and elasticity. Pay close attention to graphs and examples.
    * **Khan Academy:** Search for videos and exercises on basic microeconomic principles.  This resource provides clear explanations and practice opportunities.
    * **Investopedia:** This website offers concise definitions and articles on economic terms, helping to clarify concepts like price elasticity.
* **For MLP (Focus on mastering decision trees):**
    * **Course Slides and Notes:** Review the specific lectures and materials related to decision trees.
    * **Online Tutorials:** Websites like Stat Trek and Towards Data Science offer tutorials and examples of decision tree algorithms.
    * **Practice with Datasets:**  Work through examples using datasets available online (e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository) to build and evaluate decision trees using Python libraries like scikit-learn.


**3. Weekly Study Schedule:**

**(Allocate approximately 7-10 hours per week for focused study)**

* **Monday:** BDM - Review textbook chapter on demand and supply (2 hours). Practice problems on Khan Academy (1 hour).
* **Tuesday:** MLP - Review lecture notes on decision trees (1.5 hours). Work through a decision tree tutorial on Stat Trek (1.5 hours).
* **Wednesday:** BDM - Read Investopedia articles on elasticity and market structures (1 hour).  Review and summarize key concepts (1 hour).
* **Thursday:** MLP - Practice building a decision tree with a sample dataset (2 hours).
* **Friday:** Review and consolidate learning from both courses. Focus on connecting concepts and addressing remaining questions (1 hour).
* **Weekend:**  Optional - Explore additional practice problems or delve deeper into specific topics of interest.

**4. Additional Support Recommendations:**

* **BDM:**  Consider attending office hours or forming a study group with classmates to discuss challenging concepts and practice problem-solving.
* **MLP:**  If the "trees?" query reflects a broader confusion about different machine learning algorithms, dedicate extra time to comparing and contrasting them.  Seek clarification from the instructor or teaching assistants on specific points of confusion.
* **General Study Skills:**
    * **Active Recall:**  After studying a topic, try to recall the key information without looking at your notes. This strengthens memory retention.
    * **Spaced Repetition:** Review material at increasing intervals to reinforce learning over time.
    * **Practice Problems:**  Regularly solve practice problems to apply the concepts and identify areas where you need more practice.


This personalized plan provides a structured approach to address s2001's specific learning needs.  Consistent effort and engagement with the recommended resources will contribute to a deeper understanding of the course material and improved academic performance.  Regularly review and adjust this plan as needed based on your progress and evolving understanding.
