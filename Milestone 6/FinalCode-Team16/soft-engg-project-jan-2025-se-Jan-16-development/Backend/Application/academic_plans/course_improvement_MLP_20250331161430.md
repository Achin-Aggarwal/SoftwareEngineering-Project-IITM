# Improvement Plan for Course: MLP

## MLP Course Improvement Plan

Based on the query data, students are struggling with fundamental concepts like linear regression and, to a lesser extent, decision trees.  This suggests the current course material lacks clarity and practical application in these areas.

**1. Identified Gaps in Current Materials:**

* **Insufficient explanation of linear regression:** Three out of four queries directly ask for a definition and explanation of linear regression, indicating this concept isn't adequately covered.  One query specifically requests code examples, highlighting a need for practical application demonstrations.
* **Lack of clarity on decision trees:** While only one student asked about decision trees, it's a crucial topic in machine learning, and its presence in queries suggests potential confusion or inadequate introduction.
* **Potential absence of practical coding examples:** The query requesting code for linear regression suggests a general need for more hands-on coding exercises and examples throughout the course.

**2. Suggested Content Improvements:**

* **Expand the section on linear regression:** Provide a more detailed explanation of the underlying theory, including the mathematical formula, assumptions, and different types of linear regression (simple, multiple, polynomial).
* **Incorporate real-world examples for linear regression:**  Use case studies and datasets to demonstrate how linear regression is applied in practice. This will help students understand the relevance and application of the concept.
* **Add a dedicated section on implementing linear regression in code:** Include code examples in a commonly used language like Python, demonstrating how to perform linear regression using libraries like scikit-learn.  Provide clear explanations of the code and its functionality.
* **Clarify the introduction to decision trees:** Ensure a clear and concise definition of decision trees, explaining their purpose, structure, and how they work. Include visualizations to aid understanding.
* **Add a practical coding example for decision trees:** Similar to linear regression, provide a coded example of building and using a decision tree model, including explanations and interpretations.

**3. Recommended Additional Resources:**

* **Interactive visualizations for linear regression:** Create interactive visualizations that allow students to manipulate data and see the impact on the regression line. This will enhance their understanding of the relationship between variables.
* **Cheat sheet or summary table for linear regression formulas and assumptions:** This quick reference guide will help students remember key concepts and apply them correctly.
* **External links to reputable resources on decision trees:**  Provide links to articles, tutorials, and videos that offer alternative explanations and deeper dives into the topic.
* **Practice datasets for both linear regression and decision trees:** Offer datasets for students to practice implementing the concepts learned in the course.  Include solutions or guidelines for these datasets.

**4. Proposed Structural Changes:**

* **Introduce linear regression earlier in the course:** Given its fundamental nature and the observed student queries, consider moving the linear regression topic earlier in the curriculum. This will provide a solid foundation for subsequent topics.
* **Create a dedicated module on "Practical Implementation in Code":**  Group all coding examples and exercises within a dedicated module to emphasize the practical application of the concepts. This module could be interwoven throughout the course, following the introduction of each new algorithm or technique.
* **Consider adding a short quiz after the linear regression and decision tree sections:** This will help assess student understanding and identify areas where further clarification is needed.


By implementing these changes, the MLP course can better address student needs, improve understanding of key concepts, and provide a more engaging and practical learning experience.
