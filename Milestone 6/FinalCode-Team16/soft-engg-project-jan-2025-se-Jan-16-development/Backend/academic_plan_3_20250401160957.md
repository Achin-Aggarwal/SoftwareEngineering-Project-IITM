## Personalized Academic Plan for Student ID 3

This plan focuses on improving understanding of Axios within the context of the MAD2 course.  The student's repeated queries indicate a need for focused study in this area.

**1. Areas for Improvement:**

The student's query history clearly points to a knowledge gap in understanding and utilizing Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.  This includes potential difficulties with:

* **Making basic requests:**  Understanding the syntax and parameters for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
* **Handling responses:** Processing successful responses and managing errors effectively.
* **Interceptors:**  Using interceptors for tasks like setting headers or handling authentication.
* **Axios with Async/Await:** Integrating Axios with modern asynchronous JavaScript patterns.
* **Practical application in projects:** Applying Axios within the context of MAD2 projects and assignments.

**2. Recommended Resources:**

* **Official Axios Documentation:** The primary source for comprehensive information and API reference (axios-http.com).
* **MDN Web Docs - Fetch API:** While Axios is preferred, understanding the underlying Fetch API can be beneficial (developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
* **"Mastering Async/Await with Axios" tutorial:** Search for relevant tutorials on platforms like YouTube, Medium, or freeCodeCamp that specifically address using async/await with Axios.
* **Example projects on GitHub:** Search for repositories that demonstrate practical Axios usage in similar projects to those assigned in MAD2.  Look for well-documented examples.
* **"Axios in React" tutorials (if applicable):** If MAD2 involves React, focus on tutorials that demonstrate integrating Axios within a React application.

**3. Weekly Study Schedule:**

**(Allocate approximately 6-8 hours per week)**

* **Monday:** Review Axios documentation on basic requests (GET, POST). Practice with simple API endpoints (e.g., JSONPlaceholder). (2 hours)
* **Tuesday:** Explore error handling and response processing with Axios. Work through coding exercises that involve handling different response codes. (1.5 hours)
* **Wednesday:**  Focus on interceptors.  Implement an interceptor to add authentication headers to requests. (1.5 hours)
* **Thursday:** Deep dive into Async/Await and its integration with Axios. Refactor previous exercises to use async/await. (1.5 hours)
* **Friday:**  Apply Axios within a small MAD2-related project.  This could be a simplified version of an assignment or a personal project that uses an API. (1.5 hours)


**4. Additional Support Recommendations:**

* **Reach out to the MAD2 instructor or teaching assistants:**  Explain the specific challenges faced with Axios and ask for targeted guidance.
* **Form study groups with classmates:** Collaborate with peers to work through exercises, share resources, and discuss concepts.
* **Practice consistently:**  Regularly working with Axios is crucial for solidifying understanding.  Dedicate time each day to coding exercises.
* **Break down complex problems:**  If a problem seems overwhelming, break it down into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Use debugging tools:**  Utilize browser developer tools to inspect network requests and responses when working with Axios.
* **Don't be afraid to ask for help:**  Seek assistance from online communities, forums, or mentors if needed.


This personalized plan provides a structured approach to address the student's specific needs and improve their understanding of Axios.  Consistent effort and engagement with the recommended resources will contribute significantly to their success in MAD2.
